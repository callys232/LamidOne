/**
 * DECISION QUALITY — the real engine behind Q44.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN ANOTHER `computeAssessment` MODULE
 *
 * Q44 previously ran on the shared four-dimension archetype and had
 * three defects that no amount of tuning fixes:
 *
 *  1. IT DID NOT MEASURE ITS OWN PURPOSE. The purpose promises a check
 *     on "defined options, known criteria, a named owner" for ONE
 *     decision. The dimensions asked you to self-rate abstract
 *     "clarity" in general. Different instrument entirely.
 *
 *  2. UNANCHORED LIKERT PRODUCES NOISE. "Rate Pre-Decision Clarity
 *     0–5" has no anchor, so two people scoring the same decision
 *     disagree and one person disagrees with themselves a week later.
 *     Reporting that to one decimal place implies precision that was
 *     never in the input. Every question below is instead a binary or
 *     an ordinal with CONCRETE, OBSERVABLE anchors.
 *
 *  3. AVERAGING IS THE WRONG MODEL. This is the structural one.
 *     Decision quality is a CHAIN — the established framing from the
 *     Decision Quality literature (Spetzler et al.) is six
 *     requirements limited by the weakest link. A decision with a
 *     brilliant frame, good data and no accountable owner is not "83%
 *     good", it is blocked. A weighted mean lets four strong
 *     requirements hide the one thing that will sink it, which is
 *     precisely the failure this tool exists to catch.
 *
 * So the headline number here is the WEAKEST requirement, not the
 * average. The average is still reported, specifically so the gap
 * between them is visible — that gap is how much the mean was
 * flattering you.
