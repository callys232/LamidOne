/**
 * OBJECTIVE CONFLICT DETECTION — the engine behind Q06.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY SCORING EACH OBJECTIVE INDEPENDENTLY MISSES THE POINT
 *
 * The assessment archetype rates each objective on its own and reports
 * a mean. But an objective set can be perfect object-by-object and
 * still be incoherent, because conflict is a property of PAIRS, not of
 * individuals. "Cut cost 20%" and "raise service quality" are each
 * entirely reasonable; held together, without saying which yields,
 * they guarantee that whoever is asked to deliver both will quietly
 * pick one — and nobody will have decided which.
 *
 * This engine looks for the three ways an objective set contradicts
 * itself:
 *
 *  1. DIRECTIONAL CONFLICT. Two objectives push the same metric in
 *     opposite directions. Unresolvable by effort — one has to yield,
 *     and the only question is whether that is decided deliberately or
 *     discovered late.
 *
 *  2. RESOURCE CONTENTION. Objectives whose combined claim on a shared
 *     resource exceeds what exists. Arithmetic, not judgement: if three
 *     objectives each need 50% of one team, the plan is already 50%
 *     short whatever anyone intends.
 *
 *  3. UNARBITRATED TIES. A conflict where both sides carry equal
 *     priority is the most dangerous case, because there is no rule
 *     for resolving it and it will be resolved informally — by
 *     whoever pushes hardest, at the moment of collision.
 *
 * Priority is what makes a conflict tractable: a conflict between a
 * critical objective and a minor one is a decision already made. So
 * conflicts are reported with a RESOLUTION where priority settles it,
 * and escalated where it does not.
