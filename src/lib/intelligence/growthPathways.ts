/**
 * GROWTH PATHWAYS — the real engine behind G03.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC
 *
 * G03 is named "Growth Pathways" but ran the shared four-dimension
 * assessment archetype: rate four abstractions, get a weighted mean.
 * That answers "how good is our growth capability" — a diagnostic
 * question — when the module's name promises "which paths are open to
 * us, and which should we take", which is a RECOMMENDATION.
 *
 * The difference is not cosmetic. A score ranks you against yourself.
 * A recommendation has to compare options against each other, price
 * the risk of each, and respect the fact that you cannot pursue all of
 * them — which a weighted mean cannot express at all.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS ENCODES THAT A SCORE CANNOT
 *
 * 1. RISK IS STRUCTURAL, NOT AN OPINION. Ansoff's four quadrants are
 *    not equally risky, and their ordering is one of the most durable
 *    findings in strategy: selling more of what you have to who you
 *    already serve is far more likely to work than selling something
 *    new to someone new. So the quadrant a pathway sits in sets a
 *    base risk the user does not get to argue with — they can only
 *    change it by changing what the pathway IS.
 *
 * 2. CAPACITY IS THE BINDING CONSTRAINT. Most growth strategies fail
 *    on execution bandwidth, not on idea quality. Ranking pathways
 *    without a capacity limit produces a wish list. This returns a
 *    SEQUENCED portfolio under an explicit constraint, and says what
 *    was deferred and why.
 *
 * 3. A PORTFOLIO CAN BE WRONG WHILE EVERY ITEM IN IT IS RIGHT.
 *    Everything in the core business is slow death; everything in
 *    speculative bets is a gamble with no present. Horizon balance is
 *    checked across the selected set, not per pathway.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
