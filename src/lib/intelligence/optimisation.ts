/**
 * CONSTRAINT OPTIMISATION — the engine behind the optimisation modules
 * (P14 Productivity, P21 Process, F04 Cost Optimization).
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY "SCORE EACH STEP AND IMPROVE THE WORST" IS WRONG
 *
 * These modules promise optimisation. The assessment archetype scores
 * each step of a process independently and points at the lowest score
 * — which is the single most expensive mistake in operations, because
 * IMPROVING A NON-BOTTLENECK IMPROVES NOTHING.
 *
 * Throughput is set by the constraint. Spend on any other step and the
 * work simply queues somewhere else; the money is gone and the output
 * is unchanged. Worse, improving a step feeding the bottleneck makes
 * things actively worse by growing the queue in front of it.
 *
 * So this engine:
 *   · finds the CONSTRAINT (lowest effective capacity),
 *   · computes what the whole system can actually produce,
 *   · calculates the gain from relieving the constraint AND the point
 *     at which the constraint moves elsewhere — because there is no
 *     value in relieving it past the next-tightest step,
 *   · explicitly reports which improvements would be WASTED.
 *
 * Cost work follows the same logic in a different unit: cutting a cost
 * that is not binding on anything is a saving, but cutting one that
 * feeds the constraint reduces output by more than it saves.
